## Creating your own Add-on
If you want to create your own add-on to include in [Slack RPG](slack-rpg/slack-rpg), the fastest way is to for this repository and either add a new folder or modify the files in the default folder.

## Validating your Add-on
We have provided a script to validate your add-on to be sure it follows the format expected.
1. Install required modules using `npm install`
2. Run `npm run validate` to validate your add-on:

```
$ npm run validate
default:
- locations.json is OK!
- monsters.json is OK!
- weapons.json is OK!
- names.json is OK!
```

## Add-on Formats
### Global
All add-ons follow the same top level format:
- **type**: The type of add-on this file is for
- **version**: The version of the schema this file follows
- **data**: The actual data of your add-on

### Locations
Locations contain three types of items:

#### Names
Names consist of three arrays: pre, name, sur

Names are generated by selecting one item from each array randomly. It is then combined to form the full name. Empty strings are acceptable in pre and sur if you want the name to be short and unaltered.

Roll | pre | name  | sur
---- | --- | ----- | -------
1    |     | bob   |
2    |     | jim   | todd
3    | sir | mary  | frank
4    | mme | billy | muffins

Given a roll of 1, 3, 4 on the table above, you would end up with a name of _Marymuffins_

#### Descriptions
Descriptions is an array of short descriptions of an area. Adding the string `{{adj}}` to the description will have it replaced with a random adjective when it is built.

#### Adjectives
Adjectives is an array of adjectives to be used in a description.

Roll | adj
---- | -----
1    | funny
2    | hairy
3    | silly

Given a roll of 1 and a short description of _This is quite the {{adj}} town!_ you would end up with _This is quite the silly town!_

### Monsters
